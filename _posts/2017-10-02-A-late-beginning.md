title: A late beginning
---
A common saying in western cultures, regarding appointments and business meetings, is that *if you are not early, you are late*. There are variations on this, like *if you are on time, you are late*.
I've always have an intense dislike for these, particularly the latter.

As time passes, and experiences take us out of our comfort zone, new contexts become apparent, when there was no other before.

Instead of framing coming early as valuing my time as less worthy than that of my client or audience, if comming early to an appointment is beneficial in the long run, due to perks in the organization or business being dealt with, then *I* am valuing my time as much as the other entity is valuing its.

Another context of not coming early means being late, so obvious in hindsight, is the adoption of new technologies, software stacks, methodologies, and other plethora subjects.

I'm a software developer. Or so they say. As *many* (statistic pulled out from thin air), I feel the ship has sailed in a lot of fields. Right now with machine learning being all the rage, the chances that me and plenty of others, create "the most amazing user service/AI algorithm/bot/social network/framework/language/library/utility app/etc, that everyone will use", approaches zero at a non-zero speed. Not being early, means that by the time we get *there*, the relevance of an individual to the whole, will be much less important than in the early stages.

So, this long winded blog post originates from me, being late.
I have never seen an initial blog post that addresses itself as the first, so creating one can weird people out. People in this case meaning me, hiding behind a intangible multitude.
  
   It's been a while, since I wanted to start a blog. And many of these times, I just disregarded the idea as a waste of time. It probably is, thinks still a part of me.
   On October 1st, started the Hacktoberfest, sponsored by Digital Ocean and GitHub. Since September 27th, I was intermently thinking of setting up a simple blog in GitHub Pages. Reading on how **Jekyll** works, looking at nice themes to hide my utter lack of aptitude for aesthetics, I was supposed to start, on October 1st.
   *A pair of jekyll sites in a Docker container, and in a while, I'll just push this thru*

   But so it seems, that *late* is a state of mind that permeates everything I do.
   In the end, instead of cheating and putting another date, I decided to simply *do*.
   Maybe, one of the things I do will be done early.

 For the time being, until the next post, this one will serve as an experimental ground. Hopefully one of many.
